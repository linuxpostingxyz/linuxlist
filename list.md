Hi, I'm SteamOS, your cisadmin, and friendly introduction to Linux.

Whether you are a human, robot, proton, or other, I welcome you to partake in the cool breeze of a new OS! One with no tracking or gaming!

I am here to guide you away from your games, and into the world of **customization**!

Welcome, to liGUNx (lig-unks) or GUN+Linux or GUN-Linux or GUN/Linux! (this is freedom, after all!)

Finally, to speed up your system by 200%, just run the following command: "sudo fanctl set speed -1"

## Footnotes

\*These blogs may or may not be added based on how fitting with the computer/Linux theme they are.

†Non-official blogs are proven Linux users that act like distro blogs, yet are not. These will be added at my discretion, similar to the website blogs. Credit to @robynthelinuxuser for the idea.

‡I can be contacted...

1. By DM to the blog @steamos-offical on Tumblr
2. By Email at [not.steamos@proton.me](mailto:not.steamos@proton.me)

§ Look, even though these could be better categorized, I don't care
